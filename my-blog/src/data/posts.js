        Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm enjoy being a founder, and believe that finding new markets, executing quickly, and having competitive spirit makes life much more fulfilling :) 
      </p>

      Beyond audits and cybersec, I also have a background in AI working in some of the top Silicon Valley firms. I was frequently invited to speak at a number of conferences, this was in Miami during Art Basel. 


      In this post, I'll be discussing key aspects of operating a company
      <br/><br/><br/>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Financing</li>
        <li>2. HR</li>
        <li>3. Marketing and Product</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      <div>
      Financing is the most important aspect of a company. If you're the CEO, you'll need to understand the nuances of fundraising. What I can promise you is that if you're a first time founder, be prepared to go up against the best of the best in the world. 
      At least 3 hours each week, go through and have 3 perfect pitches to VC's. Watch the replay. Analyze what you say, as well as remember the questions they ask you. Fundraising is double edged sword. You MUST do it, but if you spend all your time on it, your business suffers. 
      Therefore, the best way to fundraise is to allocate only a portion of each week for critical VC conversations. Do your homework and filter out VC's that will be a waste of time or not a good fit for your project. 
      </div>
      <br/>
      <div>
      That means if your HR funnel is not always automatic, with an inflow of 5-7 candidate <strong>at least</strong> each week, you're going to be in trouble. The first hire you should make is a HR manager. 
      I have a VC friend who gives me really blunt advice. He tells me that if your company does not have people that have the same skill, level of detail as those that graduated from Ivy League schools or came from institutions like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Bybit, Solana or top bluechip names, often times VC's will throw your deck out after 3 seconds of viewing it. 
      Most founders can't handle this fact. However, the successful founders are sober to this fact and create KPIs so that over the course of time, the average person in their team grows closer and closer to Ivy League or high pedigree level. 
      </div>
      <br/>

      <div>
      Marketing is hard. Product takes a long time to build. In this environment (2024 to late 2025) VC's will expect a fully functional product unless you have done a successful exit before. Or your idea is a perfect fit with the narrative. 
      </div>

      Credibility and settings
      
      When it comes to hosting an event it's all about credibility. You should pick a thesis that’s relevant for the current investment narrative. E.g. lets assume we are doing one for mobile security. 

      Setting: During a large business conference such as Consensus or Devcon. See bottom of the page for upcoming events. Expect to be invited to events on your Google Calendar. 
      
      When reaching out to co-hosts and sponsors: To demonstrate past credibility, use this album just that shows pictures from past events. Feel free to add your own from recent events.

      AI Agents are a level beyond what ChatGPT can provide. AI Agents can take an abstract problem and use advanced reasoning skills to solve much more complex problems than a prompt based LLM such as ChatGPT. 

      Agents are still in its infancy but are poised for massive growth
       - The global AI agents market is set to increase from USD 5.2 billion in 2024 to USD 139.12 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 43.88% over the forecast period. 
       - The market is anticipated to grow from USD 5.29 billion in 2024 to USD 216.8 billion by 2035, indicating a CAGR of 40.15%

      Building a business is hard. I like to think of startups as a comeptitive team sport. 

      In these scnearios, your performance is a function of how well you can execute. As you begin your journey you will start to meet the people that are really good at what they do. 

      A business's goal is to buy low and sell high. This article is for people that are building tech startups. Businesses like cocacola create a recipe, distribute the goods, and sell it at insane margins. That's why they are so successful as a business. And they acquire some healthy drink companies along the way. Other businesses are like restoration hardware. Furniture is hard to transport and sell. Their margins are thinner. But theres still a market and demand for it, and they mark up the prices quite a bit, but its nothing like the 20x margins that Cocacola sometimes can get. 
      
      Software is different. Its more similar to cocacola, but the margins are even higher. However, in software the biggest cost is the cost to develop the product. In the software world, distribution is practically free. Code can be copy and pasted, or downloaded and redownloaded and it costs the publisher nothing to make another copy. 

      However, you're not competing on margins, you're competing on product market fit, the risk of incumbents with massive budgets stealing your lunch, and the risk of new entrants with even more resources. 

      Because of these challenges, it can be overwhelming from a new founder to go from theory to practice. Which is why I wrote this guide.

        The art of public speaking has evolved significantly over millennia, but some of the most effective techniques for memorizing speeches come from ancient Greece. Today, I'll share how the Greeks mastered the art of memory and how you can apply these techniques to your modern presentations.
      </p>

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GUfPBYR.jpeg" alt="Conference presentation" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />

      <p>
        The Greeks developed a powerful memorization technique called the "Method of Loci" or the "Memory Palace." This method was particularly favored by orators who needed to deliver lengthy speeches without notes. Here's how they structured their approach:
      </p>
     <br/><br/>
      <ol>
        <li>Break your speech into 7-10 key points (never more, as this is the optimal number for human memory)</li>
        <li>Associate each point with a physical location in a familiar place</li>
        <li>Create vivid, memorable images for each point</li>
        <li>Practice walking through your mental "palace" in sequence</li>
        <li>Use emotional connections to strengthen memory associations</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For example, if you're giving a business presentation about market expansion, you might visualize:
      </p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Your front door = Opening market statistics</li>
        <li>Your living room = Current market challenges</li>
        <li>Your kitchen = Resources needed for expansion</li>
        <li>Your bedroom = Growth projections</li>
        <li>Your bathroom = Risk analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zuVtgjY.jpeg" alt="Conference networking" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />

      <p>
        The Greeks understood something fundamental about human memory: we remember stories and places better than abstract facts. By turning your speech points into a journey through a familiar space, you create a natural flow that's both easier to remember and more engaging for your audience.
      </p>
      <br/><br/>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Benefits of the Greek Method:</strong>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Natural flow - points connect logically as you move through your mental space</li>
        <li>Reduced anxiety - you always know where you are in your speech</li>
        <li>Better engagement - your visualization helps create more dynamic delivery</li>
        <li>Flexibility - you can jump to any point by visualizing its location</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Practice this technique by starting with short talks and familiar spaces. As you become more comfortable, you can create more elaborate memory palaces for longer presentations. Remember, the Greeks weren't born great orators - they developed these techniques through practice and refinement.

    title: "The Tornado Cash Case - Roman Storm goes to trial",
    fullArticleUrl: "https://medium.com",
    content: `
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE</h2>
      <p>
        The invention of Tornado cash was equivalent of that of the atomic bomb. Law is intended to keep civilization civilazed, but its also designed to preserve the interests of the state. 
      </p>
      <div>
        Because after all, a states ability to exist is a function based off of its ability to defend itself. Many books have already covered these topics. I would recommend checking Guns, Germs and Steel for a more detailed thesis on that. 
      </div>
      <h1>For those that care about the future of DeFi</h1>
      <div>
        Roman Storm and his team at Tornado Cash created essentially the equivalent of the atomic bomb in crypto. It has helped adverserial state actors like Lazarus Group launder billions of dollars with 20x the ease due to how strong the encryption is and how well designed the system is. 
      </div>
      <div> 
        In this well written  <strong><a href="https://x.com/zmanian/status/1934966216000491872">X post</a></strong> it highlights how if Roman Storm loses it would send a loud and clear message that privacy has no place in crypto.

        However most people in crypto don't even realize that privacy doesn't even exist at all in the first place. Privacty is an illusion. Just look at all the resistance projects such Monero faces from essentially all governments in the world. 
      </div>
      <div>
        Privacy is power. And too much power, concentrated in the hands of those that have opposing ideas to the state, is dangerous. To give an example, you can look at books such as Surveillance Capitalism. A quick synopsis of the book is:
      </div>
      <div class="book-synopsis">
        Surveillance Capitalism, written by Shoshana Zuboff, explores how tech companies have created a new economic order that claims human experiences as free raw material. The book reveals how companies like Google and Facebook pioneered this new form of capitalism by tracking and monetizing our online behavior, turning our private experiences into behavioral data that can be analyzed, packaged, and sold to advertisers and other third parties.
      </div>
      <div class="book-synopsis">
        The implications are profound: this system threatens not just privacy but human autonomy itself. By predicting and manipulating our behavior through sophisticated algorithms and targeted content, surveillance capitalists aim to automate us, steering our behavior toward their commercial goals. The book argues this creates a fundamental threat to democracy and personal freedom, as it concentrates unprecedented power in the hands of private surveillance capital, operating outside meaningful democratic oversight.
      </div>
      <div> 
        Basically, everything is tracked - and this occurs at a hardware level. This happens whether you are in USA or China. Afterall, these 2 countries are not as different as you think.       
      </div>
      <div>
        There are companies that specialize in the use of <i>Supercookies</i> to track you across the internet. These cookies are designed to be undetectable by most browsers and are used to track your online activity even when you are not logged into a website. Yes, even when you clear your cache and cookies, these companies can still track you. 
      </div>
      <div>
        Some people may be outraged. But the truth is, without this technology then startups would have a really hard time with marketing. These supercookie companies also are responsible for tracking down bad actors - see <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jeffrey-epstein-island-visitors-data-broker-leak/">this article</a> explaining how Jeffrey Epstein got caught. 
      </div>
      <h1> What this means </h1>
      <div> 
        After the atomic bomb got invented, there were a bunch of accords and international treaties to prevent the use/abuse of the atomic bomb. The same will happen to crypto. 
      </div>
      <div>
        You see, the whole concept of supercookies is actually a solution to the problem that Tornado Cash causes. 
      </div>
