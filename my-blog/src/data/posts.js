      Credibility and settings
      
      When it comes to hosting an event it's all about credibility. You should pick a thesis thatâ€™s relevant for the current investment narrative. E.g. lets assume we are doing one for mobile security. 

      Setting: During a large business conference such as Consensus or Devcon. See bottom of the page for upcoming events. Expect to be invited to events on your Google Calendar. 
      
      When reaching out to co-hosts and sponsors: To demonstrate past credibility, use this album just that shows pictures from past events. Feel free to add your own from recent events.
