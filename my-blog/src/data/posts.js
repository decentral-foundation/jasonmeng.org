        Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm enjoy being a founder, and believe that finding new markets, executing quickly, and having competitive spirit makes life much more fulfilling :) 
      </p>

      Beyond audits and cybersec, I also have a background in AI working in some of the top Silicon Valley firms. I was frequently invited to speak at a number of conferences, this was in Miami during Art Basel. 


      In this post, I'll be discussing key aspects of operating a company
      <br/><br/><br/>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Financing</li>
        <li>2. HR</li>
        <li>3. Marketing and Product</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      <div>
      Financing is the most important aspect of a company. If you're the CEO, you'll need to understand the nuances of fundraising. What I can promise you is that if you're a first time founder, be prepared to go up against the best of the best in the world. 
      At least 3 hours each week, go through and have 3 perfect pitches to VC's. Watch the replay. Analyze what you say, as well as remember the questions they ask you. Fundraising is double edged sword. You MUST do it, but if you spend all your time on it, your business suffers. 
      Therefore, the best way to fundraise is to allocate only a portion of each week for critical VC conversations. Do your homework and filter out VC's that will be a waste of time or not a good fit for your project. 
      </div>
      <br/>
      <div>
      That means if your HR funnel is not always automatic, with an inflow of 5-7 candidate <strong>at least</strong> each week, you're going to be in trouble. The first hire you should make is a HR manager. 
      I have a VC friend who gives me really blunt advice. He tells me that if your company does not have people that have the same skill, level of detail as those that graduated from Ivy League schools or came from institutions like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Bybit, Solana or top bluechip names, often times VC's will throw your deck out after 3 seconds of viewing it. 
      Most founders can't handle this fact. However, the successful founders are sober to this fact and create KPIs so that over the course of time, the average person in their team grows closer and closer to Ivy League or high pedigree level. 
      </div>
      <br/>

      <div>
      Marketing is hard. Product takes a long time to build. In this environment (2024 to late 2025) VC's will expect a fully functional product unless you have done a successful exit before. Or your idea is a perfect fit with the narrative.

      Credibility and settings
      
      When it comes to hosting an event it's all about credibility. You should pick a thesis that’s relevant for the current investment narrative. E.g. lets assume we are doing one for mobile security. 

      Setting: During a large business conference such as Consensus or Devcon. See bottom of the page for upcoming events. Expect to be invited to events on your Google Calendar. 
      
      When reaching out to co-hosts and sponsors: To demonstrate past credibility, use this album just that shows pictures from past events. Feel free to add your own from recent events.

      AI Agents are a level beyond what ChatGPT can provide. AI Agents can take an abstract problem and use advanced reasoning skills to solve much more complex problems than a prompt based LLM such as ChatGPT. 

      Agents are still in its infancy but are poised for massive growth
       - The global AI agents market is set to increase from USD 5.2 billion in 2024 to USD 139.12 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 43.88% over the forecast period. 
       - The market is anticipated to grow from USD 5.29 billion in 2024 to USD 216.8 billion by 2035, indicating a CAGR of 40.15%

      Building a business is hard. I like to think of startups as a comeptitive team sport. 

      In these scnearios, your performance is a function of how well you can execute. As you begin your journey you will start to meet the people that are really good at what they do. 

      A business's goal is to buy low and sell high. This article is for people that are building tech startups. Businesses like cocacola create a recipe, distribute the goods, and sell it at insane margins. That's why they are so successful as a business. And they acquire some healthy drink companies along the way. Other businesses are like restoration hardware. Furniture is hard to transport and sell. Their margins are thinner. But theres still a market and demand for it, and they mark up the prices quite a bit, but its nothing like the 20x margins that Cocacola sometimes can get. 
      
      Software is different. Its more similar to cocacola, but the margins are even higher. However, in software the biggest cost is the cost to develop the product. In the software world, distribution is practically free. Code can be copy and pasted, or downloaded and redownloaded and it costs the publisher nothing to make another copy. 

      However, you're not competing on margins, you're competing on product market fit, the risk of incumbents with massive budgets stealing your lunch, and the risk of new entrants with even more resources. 

      Because of these challenges, it can be overwhelming from a new founder to go from theory to practice. Which is why I wrote this guide.

        The art of public speaking has evolved significantly over millennia, but some of the most effective techniques for memorizing speeches come from ancient Greece. Today, I'll share how the Greeks mastered the art of memory and how you can apply these techniques to your modern presentations.
      </p>

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GUfPBYR.jpeg" alt="Conference presentation" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />

      <p>
        The Greeks developed a powerful memorization technique called the "Method of Loci" or the "Memory Palace." This method was particularly favored by orators who needed to deliver lengthy speeches without notes. Here's how they structured their approach:
      </p>
     <br/><br/>
      <ol>
        <li>Break your speech into 7-10 key points (never more, as this is the optimal number for human memory)</li>
        <li>Associate each point with a physical location in a familiar place</li>
        <li>Create vivid, memorable images for each point</li>
        <li>Practice walking through your mental "palace" in sequence</li>
        <li>Use emotional connections to strengthen memory associations</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For example, if you're giving a business presentation about market expansion, you might visualize:
      </p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Your front door = Opening market statistics</li>
        <li>Your living room = Current market challenges</li>
        <li>Your kitchen = Resources needed for expansion</li>
        <li>Your bedroom = Growth projections</li>
        <li>Your bathroom = Risk analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zuVtgjY.jpeg" alt="Conference networking" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />

      <p>
        The Greeks understood something fundamental about human memory: we remember stories and places better than abstract facts. By turning your speech points into a journey through a familiar space, you create a natural flow that's both easier to remember and more engaging for your audience.
      </p>
      <br/><br/>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Benefits of the Greek Method:</strong>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Natural flow - points connect logically as you move through your mental space</li>
        <li>Reduced anxiety - you always know where you are in your speech</li>
        <li>Better engagement - your visualization helps create more dynamic delivery</li>
        <li>Flexibility - you can jump to any point by visualizing its location</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Practice this technique by starting with short talks and familiar spaces. As you become more comfortable, you can create more elaborate memory palaces for longer presentations. Remember, the Greeks weren't born great orators - they developed these techniques through practice and refinement.

    title: "The Tornado Cash Case - Roman Storm goes to trial",
    fullArticleUrl: "https://medium.com",
    content: `
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Authors Note: I'm writing this because if it weren't for Roman I would have never been as involved or interested in the crypto space. He has mentored me countless times on blockchain development, is a friend and overall a great person. 
      </p>
      <h2>DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE</h2>
      <p>
        Like the atomic bomb, Tornado Cash represents a technological breakthrough that forces us to confront the balance between innovation and control. While law preserves civilization, it primarily serves state interests.
      </p>
      <h1>The DeFi Privacy Dilemma</h1>
      <div>
        Roman Storm's Tornado Cash revolutionized crypto privacy, enabling transactions to be 5x more difficult to trace. This advancement, while powerful for legitimate privacy needs, has also aided groups like Lazarus in fund laundering.
      </div>
      <div> 
        Many pundits will make the case that code should be treated as free speech. This is a clear example of when code goes against the will of the State, you'll face much more pressure than a person expressing themselves or taking part of a political rally. Tornado cash can be a tool for thieves and terrorists to launder money. The US wants order, instead of chaos. But are they really thinking about this in the right direction? 
      </div>
      <div> 
        As this <strong><a href="https://x.com/zmanian/status/1934966216000491872">analysis shows</a></strong>, Roman Storm's trial could effectively criminalize privacy in crypto. Yet true privacy remains elusive - just look at how governments worldwide resist privacy-focused projects like Monero.
      </div>
      <div class="book-synopsis">
        Surveillance Capitalism, as Shoshana Zuboff explains, reveals how tech companies monetize our digital lives, turning personal data into profitable behavioral predictions. This system, pioneered by giants like Google and Facebook, transforms private experiences into marketable commodities.
      </div>
      <div class="book-synopsis">
        The stakes are democracy itself - these practices threaten not just privacy but human autonomy, as corporations increasingly shape behavior through targeted manipulation, all while operating outside meaningful oversight.
      </div>
      <div>
        Modern tracking occurs at the hardware level through <i>Supercookies</i> - persistent identifiers that survive browser clearing. While this enables marketing and helps catch criminals (see this <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jeffrey-epstein-island-visitors-data-broker-leak/">Epstein case study</a>), it also demonstrates the death of true digital privacy.
      </div>
      <h1>Everyone knows how to use Tornado Cash, you just don't talk about using it</h1>
      <div>
        Just as nuclear technology led to international treaties, privacy tools like Tornado Cash will require similar governance frameworks. Ironically, supercookie tracking provides a counterbalance to mixer technology, as users can still be traced at the device level.
      </div>
      <div>
        The stakes are high: While prosecuting Roman may deter privacy tools, it ignores legitimate needs - from protecting dissidents using Signal to securing crypto holders from physical threats. When even Vitalik needs a bulletproof vest, the need for privacy tools becomes clear.
      </div>
      <div>
        If you've been in the crypto space for a while, you'll eventually run into degens that will risk it all to make 10's or 100's of millions. Sometimes operating in a legal grey area. It's really not uncommon to hear at a conference "I just got my coin to pump 15x and cashing out, going to fork tornado cash this weekend and secure the bag". 
      </div>
      <div>
        Mind you these are probably UCSB undergrads literally just finished with their CS degree doing this type of work. "Forking Tornado Cash" in the crypto upper circles is really just another weekend chore for some people's side project that nets them 10M after 3 months. 
      </div>
      <div>
        The cat is out of the hat already, and theres no way to put it back in. As in, what has been seen (what's possible with Tornado cash) can no longer be unseen...
      </div> 
      <h1>A Strategic Perspective</h1>
      <div>
        Having this technology developed openly by American citizens like Roman Storm is ultimately beneficial. The alternative - secret development by actors like North Korea - could produce far more dangerous tools without the current hardware-level safeguards, potentially making fund laundering 20x easier instead of just 5x.
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2>Privacy as a Controllable Innovation</h2>
      
      <p>The Tornado Cash case underscores a fundamental tension: <strong>privacy is both a right and a risk</strong>. Just as nuclear technology demanded frameworks like the Non-Proliferation Treaty, crypto privacy tools require governance that balances individual autonomy with collective security.</p>

      <p>Yet the solution isn't to suppress privacy—it's to <strong>engineer it responsibly</strong>. The same hardware-level tracking that exposes mixer users (<em>supercookies, device fingerprints</em>) could also inform next-gen privacy systems—ones designed with compliance in mind. Imagine protocols that:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preserve anonymity</strong> for dissidents and ethical users,</li>
        <li><strong>Enable auditability</strong> for regulators when justified,</li>
        <li><strong>Resist weaponization</strong> by adversarial states.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This isn't theoretical. The infrastructure to reconcile these needs is already emerging—<em>Lucia Protocol</em> among it. By learning from Tornado Cash's pitfalls and the surveillance economy's excesses, the next wave of privacy tools can be both <strong>powerful and accountable</strong>.</p>

      <div class="closing-statement">
        <p>The question isn't whether privacy will survive, but <strong>who will build it right</strong>. The answer will define not just crypto's future, but the future of digital human rights.</p>
      </div>
