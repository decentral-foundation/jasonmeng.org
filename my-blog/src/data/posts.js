      Credibility and settings
      
      When it comes to hosting an event it's all about credibility. You should pick a thesis that’s relevant for the current investment narrative. E.g. lets assume we are doing one for mobile security. 

      Setting: During a large business conference such as Consensus or Devcon. See bottom of the page for upcoming events. Expect to be invited to events on your Google Calendar. 
      
      When reaching out to co-hosts and sponsors: To demonstrate past credibility, use this album just that shows pictures from past events. Feel free to add your own from recent events.

      AI Agents are a level beyond what ChatGPT can provide. AI Agents can take an abstract problem and use advanced reasoning skills to solve much more complex problems than a prompt based LLM such as ChatGPT. 

      Agents are still in its infancy but are poised for massive growth
       - The global AI agents market is set to increase from USD 5.2 billion in 2024 to USD 139.12 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 43.88% over the forecast period. 
       - The market is anticipated to grow from USD 5.29 billion in 2024 to USD 216.8 billion by 2035, indicating a CAGR of 40.15%
